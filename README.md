# EchoExplorer
An account-based Google Maps featuring a function that allows users to mark a point of interest. The system will notify users when they are within a 10-meter radius of the marked location through a visual cue and an audio alert. 
This breadcrumb function is activated by pressing a button. Upon pressing the button, the system will record the user's position, and a red marker will appear on the map. The marker's position will be saved in the corresponding user account in the database, by storing its latitude and longitude.
